# wombatbasis14

Construct flux basis functions and run them through an atmospheric transport model.

This is an updated version of the wombatbasis package for GEOS-Chem version 14.5.0.

This (mostly undocumented) R package is used to built flux basis functions and a construct runs of a chemical atmospheric transport model (currently GEOS-Chem version 14.5.0) based on those basis functions. It is currently used in the WOMBAT v3 framework.
