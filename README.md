# wombatbasis

Construct flux basis functions and run them through an atmospheric transport model.

This (mostly undocumented) R package is used to built flux basis functions and a construct runs of a chemical atmospheric transport model (currently GEOS-Chem version 12.3.2) based on those basis functions. It is currently used in the WOMBAT v2 framework.
